# Thunder Pack

An ARM microcontroller with built-in battery and power management system, 
all in a compact package that can fit in your pocket. 

Why? After stringing together countless portable LED controllers that consisted of wiring a flat lipo battery to a charge/boost controller to a arduino nano, I wanted something better. I always found those earlier versions to be janky, fragile and setup for the single purpose they were built for.
