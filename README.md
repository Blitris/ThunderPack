# LED String Controller
An LED string controller containing the microcontroller, battery, and power management system, 
all in a compact package that can fit in your pocket (or fist). 

Why? After stringing together countless portable LED controllers that consisted of wiring a lipo 
battery to a charge/boost controller to a arduino nano, I wanted something better. I always found 
those earlier versions to be janky, fragile and setup for the single purpose they were built for.
