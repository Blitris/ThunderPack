# EEPROM

A simple example to demonstrate storing a value in non-volatile EEPROM memory. 

When the program starts, one of the LEDs will light up. Pressing the button will light the next LED, and so on and so forth. When you turn the board off and on again, the previously lit LED will be remembered and be the starting LED.
