# Saved Values - EEPROM Emulation

A simple example demonstrating storing a value in non-volatiile memory and retrieving it when the board is powered back on.

When the program starts, one of the LEDs will light up. Pressing the button will light the next LED, and so on and so forth. When you turn the board off and on again, the previously lit LED will be remembered and be the starting LED.

## Setup
Copy `code.py` to the CIRCUITPY drive, when Thunderpack mounts to your computer.
